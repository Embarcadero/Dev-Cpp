(**
 * cairo_t:
 *
 * A #cairo_t contains the current state of the rendering device,
 * including coordinates of yet to be drawn shapes.
 *
 * Cairo contexts, as #cairo_t objects are named, are central to
 * cairo and all drawing with cairo is always done to a #cairo_t
 * object.
 *
 * Memory management of #cairo_t is done with
 * cairo_reference() and cairo_destroy().

(**
 * cairo_surface_t:
 *
 * A #cairo_surface_t represents an image, either as the destination
 * of a drawing operation or as source when drawing onto another
 * surface.  To draw to a #cairo_surface_t, create a cairo context
 * with the surface as the target, using cairo_create().
 *
 * There are different subtypes of #cairo_surface_t for
 * different drawing backends; for example, cairo_image_surface_create()
 * creates a bitmap image in memory.
 * The type of a surface can be queried with cairo_surface_get_type().
 *
 * The initial contents of a surface after creation depend upon the manner
 * of its creation. If cairo creates the surface and backing storage for
 * the user, it will be initially cleared; for example,
 * cairo_image_surface_create() and cairo_surface_create_similar().
 * Alternatively, if the user passes in a reference to some backing storage
 * and asks cairo to wrap that in a #cairo_surface_t, then the contents are
 * not modified; for example, cairo_image_surface_create_for_data() and
 * cairo_xlib_surface_create().
 *
 * Memory management of #cairo_surface_t is done with
 * cairo_surface_reference() and cairo_surface_destroy().

 * cairo_device_t:
 *
 * A #cairo_device_t represents the driver interface for drawing
 * operations to a #cairo_surface_t.  There are different subtypes of
 * #cairo_device_t for different drawing backends; for example,
 * cairo_xcb_device_create() creates a device that wraps the connection
 * to an X Windows System using the XCB library.
 *
 * The type of a device can be queried with cairo_device_get_type().
 *
 * Memory management of #cairo_device_t is done with
 * cairo_device_reference() and cairo_device_destroy().

(**
 * cairo_pattern_t:
 *
 * A #cairo_pattern_t represents a source when drawing onto a
 * surface. There are different subtypes of #cairo_pattern_t,
 * for different types of sources; for example,
 * cairo_pattern_create_rgb() creates a pattern for a solid
 * opaque color.
 *
 * Other than various cairo_pattern_create_<emphasis>type</emphasis>()
 * functions, some of the pattern types can be implicitly created
 * using various cairo_set_source_<emphasis>type</emphasis>() functions;
 * for example cairo_set_source_rgb().
 *
 * The type of a pattern can be queried with cairo_pattern_get_type().
 *
 * Memory management of #cairo_pattern_t is done with

 * #cairo_user_data_key_t is used for attaching user data to cairo
 * data structures.  The actual contents of the struct is never used,
 * and there is no need to initialize the object; only the unique
 * address of a #cairo_data_key_t object is used.  Typically, you
 * would just use the address of a static #cairo_data_key_t object.

 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_SATURATE: like over, but assuming source and dest are
 * disjoint geometries
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_MULTIPLY: source and destination layers are multiplied.
 * This causes the result to be at least as dark as the darker inputs.
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_SCREEN: source and destination are complemented and
 * multiplied. This causes the result to be at least as light as the lighter
 * inputs.

 * lightness of the destination color.
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_DARKEN: replaces the destination with the source if it

 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_EXCLUSION: Produces an effect similar to difference, but
 * with lower contrast.
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_HSL_HUE: Creates a color with the hue of the source
 * and the saturation and luminosity of the target.
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_HSL_SATURATION: Creates a color with the saturation
 * of the source and the hue and luminosity of the target. Painting with
 * this mode onto a gray area prduces no change.
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_HSL_COLOR: Creates a color with the hue and saturation
 * of the source and the luminosity of the target. This preserves the gray
 * levels of the target and is useful for coloring monochrome images or
 * tinting color images.
 * @CAIRO_OPERATOR_HSL_LUMINOSITY: Creates a color with the luminosity of

 * destination even outside of the mask layer (that is, their effect is not
 * bound by the mask layer).  However, their effect can still be limited by
 * way of clipping.

 *
 * The callback is mandatory, and expected to draw the glyph with code @glyph to
 * the cairo context @cr.  @cr is prepared such that the glyph drawing is done in
 * font space.  That is, the matrix set on @cr is the scale matrix of @scaled_font,
 * The @extents argument is where the user font sets the font extents for
 * @scaled_font.  However, if user prefers to draw in user space, they can
 * achieve that by changing the matrix on @cr.  All cairo rendering operations
 * to @cr are permitted, however, the result is undefined if any source other
 * than the default source on @cr is used.  That means, glyph bitmaps should
 * be rendered using cairo_mask() instead of cairo_paint().
 *
 * Other non-default settings on @cr include a font size of 1.0 (given that
 * it is set up to be in font space), and font options corresponding to
 * @scaled_font.
 *
 * The @extents argument is preset to have <literal>x_bearing</literal>,
 * <literal>width</literal>, and <literal>y_advance</literal> of zero,

 * positions.  That means, it allows for features like ligatures and kerning,
 * as well as complex <firstterm>shaping</firstterm> required for scripts like
 * Arabic and Indic.
 *
 * The @num_glyphs argument is preset to the number of glyph entries available
 * in the @glyphs buffer. If the @glyphs buffer is %NULL, the value of
 * @num_glyphs will be zero.  If the provided glyph array is too short for
 * the conversion (or for convenience), a new glyph array may be allocated
 * using cairo_glyph_allocate() and placed in @glyphs.  Upon return,
 * @num_glyphs should contain the number of generated glyphs.  If the value
 * @glyphs points at has changed after the call, the caller will free the
 * allocated glyph array using cairo_glyph_free().
 * The callback should populate the glyph indices and positions (in font space)
 * assuming that the text is to be shown at the origin.
 *
 * If @clusters is not %NULL, @num_clusters and @cluster_flags are also
 * non-%NULL, and cluster mapping should be computed. The semantics of how
 * cluster array allocation works is similar to the glyph array.  That is,
 * if @clusters initially points to a non-%NULL value, that array may be used
 * as a cluster buffer, and @num_clusters points to the number of cluster
 * entries available there.  If the provided cluster array is too short for

 * using cairo_text_cluster_allocate() and placed in @clusters.  Upon return,
 * @num_clusters should contain the number of generated clusters.
 * If the value @clusters points at has changed after the call, the caller

 *
 * The callback is optional.  If @num_glyphs is negative upon
 * the callback returning or if the return value
 * is %CAIRO_STATUS_USER_FONT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, the unicode_to_glyph callback
 * is tried.  See #cairo_user_scaled_font_unicode_to_glyph_func_t.
 *
 * Note: While cairo does not impose any limitation on glyph indices,

 *
 * #cairo_path_data_t is used to represent the path data inside a
 * #cairo_path_t.
 *
 * The data structure is designed to try to balance the demands of
 * efficiency and ease-of-use. A path is represented as an array of
 * #cairo_path_data_t, which is a union of headers and points.
 *
 * Each portion of the path is represented by one or more elements in
 * the array, (one header followed by 0 or more points). The length
 * value of the header is the number of array elements for the current
 * portion including the header, (ie. length == 1 + # of points), and
 * where the number of points for each element type is as follows:
 *
 * <programlisting>
 *     %CAIRO_PATH_MOVE_TO:     1 point
 *     %CAIRO_PATH_LINE_TO:     1 point
 *     %CAIRO_PATH_CURVE_TO:    3 points

 * </programlisting>
 *
 * The semantics and ordering of the coordinate values are consistent
 * with cairo_move_to(), cairo_line_to(), cairo_curve_to(), and
 * cairo_close_path().
 *
 * Here is sample code for iterating through a #cairo_path_t:
 *
 * <informalexample><programlisting>

 *          case CAIRO_PATH_MOVE_TO:

 *
 * As of cairo 1.4, cairo does not mind if there are more elements in
 * a portion of the path than needed.  Such elements can be used by
 * users of the cairo API to hold extra values in the path data
