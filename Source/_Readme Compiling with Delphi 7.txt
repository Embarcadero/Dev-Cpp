1) Install the following packages by double clicking them and clicking on compile and/or install:

.\VCL\DevCpp.dpk
.\VCL\SynEditPackages\SynEdit_D7.dpk
.\VCL\ClassBrowsing\ClassBrowsing.dpk

2) Compile resources: run .\CompileResources.bat to create binary .res files.

3) Opening and using the main project file 'devcpp.dpr' should not bring up any 'not found' errors now.

4) Other versions of Delphi should work, but I've only tested Delphi 7.
