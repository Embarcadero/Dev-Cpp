1. Compiling devcpp.exe

The main executable devcpp.exe can be built using the following steps:

	1) Install
		VCL Style - Windows10BlueWhale from GetIt in the IDE.
		https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/VCLStyle-Windows10BlueWhale-1.0/
		VCL Style - Calypso from GetIt in the IDE.
		https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/VCLStyle-Calypso-1.0/
		VCL Style - FlatUILight from GetIt in the IDE.
		https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/VCLStyle-FlatUILight-1.0/
		VCL Style - MaterialPatternsBlue from GetIt in the IDE.
		https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/VCLStyle-MaterialPatternsBlue-1.0/
		VCL Style - Windows10BlackPearl from GetIt in the IDE.
		https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/VCLStyle-Windows10BlackPearl-1.0/
	1) Compile and install the following package(s):
		Source\VCL\DevCpp.dpk
		Source\VCL\SynEdit\Packages\Sydney\Delphi\SynEditDelphi.groupproj
		Source\VCL\ClassBrowsing\ClassBrowsing.dpk
		Source\VCL\SVGIconImageList\Packages\D10_4\SVGIconImageListGroupPackages.groupproj

	2) Compile resources by running the following script(s):
		Source\CompileResources.bat
		
	3) Open the project file devcpp.dpr. Your IDE should not produce any 
	   'Module Not Found' or 'Resource Not Found' errors when opening files, 
	   compiling files or running devcpp.exe.

	4) It is advisable to run CleanSource.bat before commiting work, when you
	   get errors complaining about old versions of code or when you want to 
	   diff the source folder.

This process has only been tested using Delphi 6 and Delphi 7. The code base
should be compatible with more recent versions of Delphi, but there is no 
guarantee anything will work.

2. Compiling associated tools

There are a couple of executables that need to be compiled and/or put in the
right folder when building a full release. The source code of these files can be
found in the Source\Tools subfolder. Precompiled versions are available in the
Tools folder in the SourceForge repository. These three associated are required
to be present by the setup scripts:

	1) ConsolePauser.exe. This needs to be put in the root directory next to
	   devcpp.exe. This executable is launched by devcpp.exe when a console 
	   program is run and the option "Pause console programs after return" is
	   enabled in Environment Options. This file can be compiled using
	   Source\Tools\ConsolePauser\ConsolePauser.dev
	   
	2) devcppPortable.exe. This file should be provided with all builds of
	   Dev-C++ (also the nonportable ones) and should also be placed in the root
	   directory. Launching this executable will run devcpp.exe and tell it to
	   store configuration files in the program directory instead of in
	   %APPDATA%\Dev-Cpp. This file can be compiled using
	   Source\Tools\DevCppPortable\DevCppPortable.dev
	   
	3) Packman.exe (legacy). This file is launched by the menu item located at
	   Tools >> Package Manager and provides .pak plugin support. This file has
	   not been touched since like 2005 so do what you wish with it.
	   
3. Other tools

Other tools provided for legacy reasons or to easy the developer's life are:

	1) GitPush. Automated script that adds, commits, and pushes the current code
	   base to the SourceForge git repo. Please position this executable in the
	   root folder of Dev-C++.
	   
	2) HeywordHighlighter. Used to generate the hash table of function pointers
	   used by SynEditHighlighterCpp.pas to determine if a word is a keyword.
	   
	3) LangCheck. Compares any language file to the english language file and
	   checks for missing entries and formatting options compatibility.
	   
	4) PackMaker (legacy). Used to create PAK extension files.
	   
4. UPX

To decrease the main executable size, the old developers from Bloodshed used a
program called UPX to compress it. Here is a copy of their instructions on how
to use it (I don't, since the mere megabyte you save in size pales to the 330MB
of the provided compiler):

	When compressing with upx (Ultimate Packer for Executables) use:
	
	upx -9 --compress-icons=0 devcpp.exe
	
	Otherwise upx will compress all icons and the file associations will point
	to nonexisting (moved) icons within devcpp.exe
	
5. Shortcut Map

This is an up to date map of the default shortcuts of Dev-C++. All Ctrl+(Letter)
combinations are in use, except for the following letters: UJKL. The Shift 
modifier should be added to a shortcut to signify a multiplicated version
of the regular shortcut. The use of Ctrl+Alt+(Key) or Shift+(Key) should be
avoided.
