    <h1>Artistic Style Scripts</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The following are scripts to support the Artistic Style program. They are in various computer languages for multiple
        platforms.</p>

    <h3>Scripts</h3>

    <p>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/scripts/astyle-clean.py.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            <strong>astyle-clean.py</strong></a>&nbsp; is a <strong>Python script</strong> to clean a directory tree by
        moving Artistic Style backup files to a separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files
        without cluttering your source directories. There are four variables at the start of the script that need to be
        set for each application. The script will move or copy backup files to a backup directory maintaining the original
        directory structure. New backup files will be copied over the old so you will always have the most current 
        backup.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/scripts/astyle-clean.sh.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            <strong>astyle-clean.sh</strong></a>&nbsp; is a <strong>Linux shell script</strong> to clean a directory tree
        by moving Artistic Style backup files to a separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files
        without cluttering your source directories. There are four variables at the start of the script that need to be
        set for each application. The script will move or copy backup files to a backup directory maintaining the original
        directory structure. New backup files will be copied over the old so you will always have the most current 
        backup.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/scripts/astyle-clean.bat.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            <strong>astyle-clean.bat</strong></a>&nbsp; is a <strong>Windows batch file</strong> to clean a directory
        tree by moving Artistic Style backup files to a separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup
        files without cluttering your source directories. There are four variables at the start of the script that need
        to be set for each application. The script will move or copy backup files to a backup directory maintaining the
        original directory structure. New backup files will be copied over the old so you will always have the most current
        backup.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/scripts/astyle.pl.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            <strong>astyle.pl</strong></a>&nbsp; is a <strong>Mac Perl script</strong> to indent source files in TextWrangler
        and BBEdit using Artistic Style. Selected text from the editor can be passed to Artistic Style and replaced with
        the reformatted text. Save the script in the "Unix Filters" directory (you need to restart TextWrangler to see
        new scripts). Then simply highlight the text you would like to indent, choose the script from the Shebang (<code>#!</code>)
        menu, and the text will be immaculately formatted. You can add Artistic Style options to the "my $astyle" line
        in the script.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/scripts/indent-commit.pl.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            <strong>indent-commit.pl</strong></a>&nbsp; is a <strong>Perl script</strong> to integrate Artistic Style
        with a CVS repository check-in. Before code is checked in, Artistic Style is automatically called so that the
        repository files have a consistent style. This script was posted on the web site several years ago and probably
        needs to be updated.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/scripts/astyle-hooks.el.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            <strong>astyle-hooks.el</strong></a>&nbsp; is an <strong>Emacs Lisp script</strong> containing hooks to convert
        Emacs default styles to Artistic Style default styles. There are hooks for C++, Java, and C# files. The C# hook
        requires the csharp-mode.el file from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/csharpmode/" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            csharpmode</a> on Google Project Hosting. For best results Artistic Style should use the options &#8209;&#8209;min&#8209;conditional&#8209;indent=0
        (&#8209;m0) and &#8209;&#8209;max&#8209;continuation&#8209;indent=50 (&#8209;M50). Emacs does not seem to have
        an option equivalent to these. The formatting for Emacs and Artistic Style will not be identical, but should be
        reasonably close.</p>
