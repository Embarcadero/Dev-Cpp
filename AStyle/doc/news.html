    <h3>
        Artistic Style 2.03&nbsp; (April 2013)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.</p>
    <p>
        A new option, "max-code-length=#" or "xC#", will limit the length of code on a line. A new option "break&#8209;after&#8209;logical",
        or "xL", will modify a line break for conditionals. See the documentation for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "pad-first-paren-out" or "xd", will pad only the first paren in a series on the outside. See the
        documentation for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "indent=force-tab-tab=#" or "xT#", will allow force tab indents with a tab length that is different
        than the indent length. See the documentation for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short option for delete-empty-lines has changed from "xd" to "xe".
    </p>
    <p>
        The C++11 standard for range-based "for" loops, "enum" with a base type, 
        and rvalue references is now supported. The formatting of rvalue references is determined from the existing &quot;align-pointer&quot; and 
        &quot;align-reference&quot; options.</p>
    <p>
        Closing the ending angle brackets of templates is now allowed by the C++11 standard. A new option, &quot;close-templates&quot;
        or "xy", will close the whitespace in the angle brackets of template definitions. Be sure your compiler supports
        this before making the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The C/C++ keyword 'extern "C"' in a preprocessor no longer causes an extra indent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Formatting of C++/CLI managed pointers (the &#39;^&#39; character) has been added to the &quot;align-pointer&quot;
        option.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;The breaking of switch &quot;default&quot; statements has been fixed. The &quot;default&quot; statements that have been incorrectly 
        broken will be fixed in this release.
    </p>
    <p>
        The byte order mark (BOM) has been removed from ASLocalizer.cpp for all platforms. The encoding of the file is
        UTF-8.
        Many Windows editors can now recognize UTF-8 encoding without the BOM. Visual Studio has an option that needs 
        to be set. With others. such as CodeBlocks, identification is automatic. On Linux, UTF-8 is the default 
        encoding.</p>
    <p>
        Translations have been added for Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish,
        and Ukrainian. The translations were done with an automated translation program, Google Translate, so they may
        not be the best translation possible. The translations are at the end of ASLocalizer.cpp in the form of an English&#8209;Translation
        pair. If you correct a translation, send the source as a bug report and it will be included in the next release.
        To add a language, see "Internationalization" in the "General Information" section of the documentation. Send
        the addition as a bug report and it will be included in the next release.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a new 
        Linux makefile for the Clang Compiler. Clang is a free compiler can be installed as a package on many
        Linux distributions. Some of its features are fast compiles, low memory use, expressive diagnostic messages,
        and GCC compatibility. It includes a static analyzer tool that finds potential bugs in your source code. An experimental
        version can be installed on a Windows platform. There 
        is more information in the Install Information documentation.</p>
    <p>
        Visual Studio automatically creates an import library and an export file when you link a program that contains
        exports. It will do this for even a static library if it contains a __declspec(dllexport) definition. The Artistic 
        Style library (ASTYLE_LIB) build contains such exports which causes an import library and export file to be 
        created when they may not be needed. A new preprocessor definition, ASTYLE_NO_VCX (no Visual Studio exports) 
        can be declared to eliminate the files from the output. Use this only for static libraries or when the AStyle
        source is included in the compile. Do NOT use this when compiled as a shared (dynamic) library. It is 
        effective only for Visual Studio 2012. It will NOT work with previous versions. It has no effect with other 
        compilers since they require a separate option to create the import library and export files.<o:p></o:p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The executable included in the Windows distribution was compiled with
        Visual Studio 2010 (platform toolset v100). Visual Studio 2012 
        (platform toolset v110) contains dependencies on Windows API functions that exist only on Windows Vista, 
        Windows 7, and Windows 8. This means that applications built with a Visual Studio 2012 C++ compiler 
        would fail to load and execute on Windows XP. Artistic Style was therefore compiled with Visual Studio 2010 to
        work on computers using Windows XP.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are using Windows Vista or higher, and have the Visual Studio 2012 compiler available, recompiling with
        Visual Studio 2012 will probably result in faster execution. The Windows distribution has Visual Studio 2012 
        project files available.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use a compiler other than Visual Studio, you can probably get better execution by compiling using the 
        C++11 standards. Artistic Style uses a lot of string vectors and the new move semantics will probably result 
        in faster execution. (To use C++11 on GCC and MinGW use the option --std=c++0x). This may change on future 
        compiler releases.).
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Developer Information" page has a new example and download for calling Artistic Style from a Python script.
        It will run with both Python 2 and Python 3. Using Python 3 shows an example of formatting a Unicode string with
        Artistic Style. Unicode strings must be encoded to UTF-8 before formatting and decoded back to Unicode afterward.
        The example script shows the technique for doing this. It also shows how to set up the function pointers and allocate
        memory in Python.
            
    <p>
        If you use Visual Studio on Windows, it can now be used for Python development. <a href="https://pytools.codeplex.com/"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a> (PTVS) is a free and open source
        plug-in for Visual Studio 2010 that supports Python and Iron Python. Other interpreters such Jython can
        be added. It can be easily switched between Python versions or different interpreters. But the best thing is the
        Visual Studio debugging support using the .NET debugger and the normal Visual Studio debugger. It enables you
        to set break points, step through functions, change the current statement, inspect local variables, and perform
        other operations while debugging.
        It is best to use it with a project file, a minor irritation for single page scripts. And there are some minor
        bugs. But overall it works quite well.

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 2.02&nbsp; (May 2011)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.</p>

    <h4>
        Release 2.02.1 - November 2011</h4>

    <p>
        This bug fix release is issued because of the length of time required for the some of the changes in the next
        release (2.03). Bugs with the breaking of "case" statements and a crash with pointer to pointer (**) in align-pointer=type
        have been fixed. The "case" statements that have been incorrectly broken will be fixed in this release. Pointers
        and references are now processed for C# files. See the "Release Notes" for more information and additional changes.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <strong>The following information is for the original 2.02 release.</strong></h4>

    <h4>
        Translations</h4>

    <p>
        A new program module and header, ASLocalizer.cpp and ASLocalizer.h, have been added. These are required for the
        console build and are optional for the library builds. It contains language translations for several of the most
        common users of Artistic Style. The method used was adapted from the Gnu "gettext" method.</p>
    <p>
        The translation to use is determined from the User Locale for Windows and the LANG environment variable for other
        systems. The translation will be done automatically from these settings. If no translation is available it will
        default to English.</p>
    <p>
        A new option, "ascii" or "I", will display the text in English regardless of your system settings. This option
        must be input from the command line and not an option file. See the documentation for details.</p>
    <p>
        The translations were mostly done with an automated translation program, Google Translate, so they may not be
        the best translation possible. The translations are at the end of ASLocalizer.cpp in the form of an English&#8209;Translation
        pair. If you correct a translation, send the source as a bug report and it will be included in the next release.</p>
    <p>
        To add a language, add a new translation class to ASLocalizer.h. Add the English&#8209;Translation pair to the
        constructor in ASLocalizer.cpp. Update the WinLangCode array, if necessary, and add the language code to the function
        setTranslationClass(). The ASLocalizer.cpp program contains comments that give web pages for obtaining the LCIDs
        and language codes. Send the source code as a bug report and it will be included in the next release.</p>

    <h4>
        Brackets</h4>

    <p>
        Since release 1.22 (April 2008) the predefined styles have increased from 5 to 12 and the bracket types have increased
        from 4 to 6. Having two different ways of defining bracket styles has resulted in some confusion and unnecessary
        duplication. This release starts a redesign of the bracket definitions to simplify the user interface. The predefined
        styles and bracket types will be combined into a single option category.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Predefined Style" options have been renamed "Bracket Style" options. The "Bracket Options" have been depreciated
        and will be removed in a future release. If you are using a "brackets=" option, you should start changing to one
        of the "style=" options. There is a "style" option available for every "brackets" option.</p>
    <p>
        All "Bracket Style" options now default to 4 spaces per indent. If you were using a "Predefined Style" with a
        default indent other than 4, you will need to add one of the "Tab Options" to maintain the same indentation. The
        styles which used indents other than 4 were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stroustrup - 5 spaces per indent. </li>
        <li>Gnu - 2 spaces per indent. </li>
        <li>Linux - 8 spaces per indent. </li>
        <li>Horstmann - 3 spaces per indent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is a new "Bracket Style" option "style=pico" or "A11". It uses run-in brackets, like Horstmann style, and
        attaches the closing bracket to the last line in the block. It sets the options "keep one line blocks" and "keep
        one line statements". This is a very compact style and is a good style for small monitors.</p>
    <p>
        Another new "Bracket Style" option is "style=lisp" or "style=python" or "A12". It uses attached brackets, like
        Java style, and attaches the closing bracket to the last line in the block. It sets the option "keep one line
        statements". This style makes indentation the only way of distinguishing blocks of code, but has the advantage
        of containing no uninformative lines. Like Pico, it is also a very compact style.</p>
    <p>
        The option "brackets=horstmann" has been removed. Instead use "style=horstmann" or "A9". The short option "g"
        is now equivalent to the new "brackets=run-in". Run-in brackets are used for both Horstmann and Pico styles.</p>
    <p>
        The option "indent-brackets" and short option "B" have been removed. Instead use "style=whitesmith" or "style=banner".</p>
    <p>
        The option "indent-blocks" and short option "G" have been removed. Instead use "style=gnu".</p>
    <p>
        Two new options, "style=break" and "style=attach", have been added for Allman and Java bracket styles respectively.</p>

    <h4>
        Other Changes</h4>

    <p>
        To allow for future expansion the short options will now allow an "x" prefix to be used. New short options may
        start with an "x" and will be followed by another character (e.g. "xa", "xb", "xc" ...). The current options,
        with one exception, will still be valid.</p>
    <p>
        The short option for "delete-empty-lines" has been changed from "x" to "xd" to allow for the expansion of short
        options.</p>
    <p>
        A new option "align-reference=" (-W#) allows references to be aligned separate from pointers. See the documentation
        for details.</p>
    <p>
        Since computer screens are getting wider the maximum value for "max-instatement-indent" has been increased from
        80 to 120.</p>
    <p>
        New options ignore&#8209;exclude&#8209;errors (&#8209;i) and ignore&#8209;exclude&#8209;errors&#8209;x (&#8209;xi)
        will allow processing to continue if there are errors in the "exclude" options. This lets the excludes for several
        projects to be entered in a single option file. The "ignore" options may be placed in the same option file as
        the excludes. The ignore&#8209;exclude&#8209;errors option will display the unmatched excludes, ignore&#8209;exclude&#8209;errors&#8209;x
        will not display them.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style can now format UTF-16 encoded files, both little and big endian. This encoding is the default for
        Visual Studio Unicode files. The file is formatted by converting it to UTF&#8209;8 and then back to UTF&#8209;16.
        The conversion process does not add a significant amount of time to the formatting. The UTF-16 file must be encoded
        with a byte-order-mark (BOM) to be recognized. Again, this is the Visual Studio default.</p>
    <p>
        The Visual Studio project files now have a solution for both Win32 and x64 compiles. The x64 version will be needed
        if you are using an Artistic Style DLL for Java or C# on a Windows&nbsp;7 platform. Or you may just prefer an
        x64 console program. The executable included in the Windows distribution is still Win32. It will work on both
        Win32 and x64 systems.</p>
    <p>
        If you use Visual Studio C++ Express the 2010 release has the ability to compile x64 code. But you must use Vista
        or Windows&nbsp;7 and need to install the .NET Framework SDK. I have created a brief instruction page <a href="vsinstall.html"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">here</a>. Note that a fix is required if you apply Service Pack&nbsp;1
        after installing the .NET Framework SDK.</p>
    <p>
        The documentation contains a new section "Command-line Only" which lists commands that are not available from
        an options file. The options were transferred from the "Other Options" section.</p>
    <p>
        Thanks to Milian Wolff, Johannes Martin, and Arne F?rlie, and Marvin Humphrey for their contributions. The UTF&#8209;8
        and UTF&#8209;16 conversions were obtained from the SciTE source code editor.</p>

    <h4>
        Survey Results</h4>

    <p>
        The results of the survey posted last release are available at <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/SurveyGeneralInfo.html"
            target="survey" title="open new window">General Information</a> and <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/SurveyOptions.html"
                target="survey" title="open new window">Artistic Style Options</a>. Thanks to everyone who took the time
        to complete it.</p>
    <p>
        Surveys give an indication of how many people are using an option or want certain features. This is information
        that is not available in the bug reports.</p>
    <p>
        In the "Enhancements" group there were three items with multiple requests. The most frequent request by far was
        to enforce a maximum line length. This is also the oldest request in the bug reports. Another item with multiple
        requests was to disable/enable Artistic Style formatting on request within source files. This is the second oldest
        request in the bug reports. A third item with multiple requests was to customize namespace brackets independent
        of the requested bracket style. I will try to address these in the next release.</p>
    <p>
        Things that stand out to me in the multiple&#8209;choice sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The predefined styles and brackets options were each used about 50% each. That will change with this release.</li>
        <li>Over 50% of the survey uses Artistic Style for Windows. I have been working for a couple of years on a new program
            based on wxWidgets. I will try to give this more priority in the future. </li>
        <li>Over 75% of the survey uses Artistic Style to format entire projects.</li>
        <li>About one&#8209;third of the Windows C++ users use Artistic Style for Managed C++.</li>
        <li>The most popular option is add&#8209;brackets (60%), which was just recently added.</li>
        <li>The attach&#8209;pointer options, in total (70%), are even more popular than add-brackets. They were also recently
            added.</li>
        <li>The preserve-date option is used by nearly one-third of the survey.</li>
        <li>All of the options are used by someone in the survey, even the ones I thought were outdated. The bracket styles
            that are not used are probably a result of not having enough response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        Developers</h4>

    <p>
        The <a href="http://jimp03.zxq.net/" target="astyle" title="open new window">Artistic Style for Windows</a> program
        contains a sample GUI using the new bracket style options. The old predefined styles are now the bracket styles.
        The bracket options have been removed along with the indent&#8209;brackets and indent&#8209;blocks options. The
        new bracket styles all use the same default indent of 4 spaces, therefore it is not necessary to set an indentation
        from the bracket style. The new format is available for use with this release.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 2.01&nbsp; (November 2010)
    </h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.</p>
    <p>
        A new feature at SourceForge is download maps that show a list of downloads by country. It is available from the
        top menu at Develop &gt; Download Stats (Beta), and clicking on the "top country" area. The list of downloads
        shows about 75% of Artistic Style downloads are from non English speaking countries. This release is the start
        of the internationalization of Artistic Style.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style now sets the native local so that characters from the user&#8217;s native language will be recognized
        in directory names and file names. Artistic Style for Windows has also been changed to use the native locale.
        For Linux systems using UTF-8 locales, characters from any language will be recognized and any combination of
        languages can be used. For Windows, only languages recognized by the native codepage can be used. For example,
        the English locale (codepage 1252) also has French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, plus several other languages.
        Other locals, such as Chinese and Japanese, only support one language. Unicode was not used due to the varying
        degree of support by different compilers for console applications.</p>
    <p>
        The locale setting also affects the way numbers are displayed. Language translations may be provided in a future
        release.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a major release (2.01) because of the internationalization and changes that will occur in the next couple
        of releases. Future releases will contain a major change to the bracket options and a rewrite of the file access
        method. Some of the requested changes require looking at blocks of code instead of single lines. The current program
        has been patched to do this but a rewrite of the file input is needed. These are both major changes but with the
        new test framework in place they should be manageable.</p>
    <p>
        There has been a change to the &#8209;&#8209;min&#8209;conditional&#8209;indent option. Instead of using the number
        of spaces it now uses a code expressed in number of indents. This will allow the option to be set independently
        of the spaces per indent. If you are using the default setting of two indents, or a setting of zero indents, there
        is no change necessary to the input. Otherwise, check the documentation for the new codes.</p>
    <p>
        The --style=linux has been changed to ALWAYS use a minimum conditional indent of one-half the indent length. This
        is in the style definition and cannot be changed. If you do not want this setting use the K&amp;R style instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        The MFC macros BEGIN_DISPATCH_MAP, BEGIN_EVENT_MAP, and BEGIN_PROPPAGEIDS are now formatted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Checksum verification has been added to source file output that will help assure that no code has been duplicated
        or omitted. This is effective only in the debug configuration used for testing.</p>
    <p>
        The test framework has been changed from UnitTest++ to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/" target="_blank"
            title="open new window">Google Test</a>, which is actively maintained, has a mock object framework (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/"
                target="_blank" title="open new window">Google Mock</a>), and good documentation. Regression and system
        testing have been automated with Python scripts. Python has also been used for class verification checks and other
        repetitive procedures.</p>

        If you use Visual Studio C++ Express the 2010 release has the ability to create x64 code. But you must use Vista
        or Windows 7 and need to install the .NET Framework SDK. I have created a brief instruction page <a href="vsinstall.html"

    <p>
        On the library build of Artistic Style, the second argument of the fpError typedef and the javaErrorHandler declaration
        has been changed from "char*" to "const char*". This could cause a compile error if not changed in the source
        statements.</p>
    <p>
        There has been a change in the &#8209;&#8209;min&#8209;conditional&#8209;indent option. Instead of using number
        of spaces to indent it now uses a code expressed in number of indents. In the past this option was a problem because
        it was also affected by changes in indent length. With this release there is only one variable affected. The option
        is not affected by changes in indent length. The minimum conditional indent length is computed automatically by
        ASFormatter after all the options have been processed. Refer to the code in astyle_main.cpp to see how the option
        is processed.</p>
    <p>
        The --style=linux has been changed to ALWAYS use a minimum conditional indent of one-half the indent length. The
        option is set in the function fixOptionVariableConflicts.</p>
    <p>
        The use of locales affects only the command line build.</p>
