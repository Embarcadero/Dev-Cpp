    <h1>
        Artistic Style Subversion Repository</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style</h3>

    <p>
        The latest development source is in the Artistic Style repository at SourceForge. It can be checked out using
        Subversion. The source code is under development and some changes take several weeks to complete. The intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        The repository address is "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle". The current version is in the "trunk/AStyle"
        branch of the repository. The file and directory names in the repository are case sensitive.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle/trunk/AStyle"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyle"</strong></p>
    <p>
        Note that the URLs used to access the repository will change when the project is upgraded to the Allura platform
        by SourceForge. SourceForge should provide information on the new URLs.</p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/">browse the subversion repository</a>. The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you a view into the current status of the project's code without actually checking-out the files.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Other Projects</h3>

    <p>
        Two additional Artistic Style projects are available in the repository. They are not maintained for the general
        public but are available if you want them. You may have to create your own project files and scripts to use them.
        These projects require the Artistic Style project above. They are an extension that requires the Artistic Style
        source. All projects, and any additional source required, should be installed in the same top level folder.</p>

    <h4>
        AStyleDev</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleDev contains the development files that are made available in the "Developer Information" section. Refer
        to that section for more information.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyledev"</p>
    <p>
        Note that the URLs used to access the repository will change when the project is upgraded to the Allura platform
        by SourceForge. SourceForge should provide information on the new URLs.</p>

    <h4>
        AStyleTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for Artistic Style.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle/trunk/AStyleTest"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyletest"</p>
    <p>
        Note that the URLs used to access the repository will change when the project is upgraded to the Allura platform
        by SourceForge. SourceForge should provide information on the new URLs.</p>
    <p>
        In addition to the Artistic Style source the test program requires
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/"
            target="astyle" title="open new window">Google Mock</a>. This is the Google multi-platform framework for writing C++ 
        unit tests. The main Artistic Style test project, AStyleTest, actually uses &quot;integration&quot; tests instead of 
        &quot;unit&quot; tests. This type of testing can be effective for programs that were written without unit tests to begin 
        with.</p>
    <p>
        An optional leak finder program can be added if you
        are using Visual Studio. The <a href="https://vld.codeplex.com/" target="astyle"
            title="open new window">Visual Leak Detector</a> should be installed in the default install directory
        (C:\Program Files (x86)\Visual Leak Detector). You do NOT need to change the &quot;PATH&quot; environment variable.
        It can be downloaded from the website or installed from standard versions of Visual Studio 2012 from the 
        &quot;Tools &gt; Extensions and Updates&quot; menu.</p>
