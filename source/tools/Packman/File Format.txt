                             Dev-C++ Package File Format
                         Version 1 - March the 15th, 2002


General Information
-------------------
The content of the package is described using a package description file,
which has the extension .DevPackage.
The file is really a simple INI file.


Sections
--------
The .DevPackage file contains two sections:
[Setup]
This section contains information about the package, such as package name,
version, description, readme, license, etc.

[Files]
This section contains information about files, and where they should be
installed to.


The [Setup] section
-------------------
This section *must* contain at least the following keys:
Version		The package format's version number. A higher version number means
		that this package is not compatible with older package managers.
AppName		A name for the package. Example: MyApp
AppVerName	The package's name and the version together. Example: MyApp version 1.0
AppVersion	The package's version number. Example: 1.0
MenuName	A name for a menu group for this package.

The following keys are optional:
Url		An URL to the library's website.
Picture		A logo/picture/whatever that will be displayed.
Description	A desription for the package.
Readme		A filename to the Readme file, relative to the .DevPackage file.
		Example: README.TXT
License		A filename to the license file, relative to the .DevPackage file.
		Example: COPYING.TXT
Reboot		Wether the package requires a reboot or not in order to function properly.
		The value can be either 1 (true) or 0 (false).
Dependencies    A comma-seperated list of package names that this package depends on.


The [Files] section
-------------------
Keys in the Files section are composed in the following format:
Source=Destdir\[FileName][;Flags]

Source (required):
The name of the source file, relative to the .DevPackage file.
This can be a directory, in which case all files inside that directory will be copied.

Destdir (required):
The destination directory. PLease note that Destdir must *always* end with a
backslash (\). Otherwise it will be interpreted as FileName.

FileName (optional):
If this is specified, the copied file will be renamed to the specified filename.

Flags (optional):
An extra set of options.
recursive	If Source is a directory, the installer will recurse into any
		subdirectories and copy the files inside those subdirectories too.

Constants:
Sourcedir and Destdir can contain constants. A constant will be replaced to their
literal value, depending on the user's configuration. The constants' names are not
case sensitive.
<app>		Dev-C++'s root directory (usually C:\Dev-C++).
<src>		The source directory (the directory where the .DevPackage file is located).
<win>		The system's Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS).
<sys>		The system's Windows System directory (usually C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM).


Examples:
Foo.txt=<app>\				Installs to C:\Dev-C++\Foo.txt
Bar.h=<app>\include\FooBar.h		Installs to C:\Dev-C++\include\FooBar.h
L33t.dll=<sys>\				Installs to C:\WINDOWS\System\L33t.dll
WindowsSucks.exe=<win>\Explorer.exe	Installs to C:\WINDOWS\Explorer.exe
BigFolder=C:\;recurive			Installs all files in BigFolder, including
					all files inside any subfolders, to C:\


The [Icons] section
-------------------
This section is ignored if MenuName (in the Setup section) is not given.

Entries in this section describe what menu items should be created.
Each entry has the following format:
Name=Target[,Icon Filename]

Target can contain constants as described in the Files section.


Examples:

[Setup]
MenuName=GTK
[Icons]
Website=http://www.gtk.org/

This will create the menu group "Start->Programs->Bloodshed Dev-C++->GTK",
with 1 menu item, called Website, which points to http://www.gtk.org/


[Setup]
MenuName=FLTK
[Icons]
UI Designer=<app>\bin\Fluid.exe,<app>\Icons\Fluid.ico
Website=http://www.fltk.org/

Let's assume that Dev-C++ is installed in C:\Dev-C++.
This will create the menu group "Start->Programs->Bloodshed Dev-C++->FLTK",
with 2 menu items:
- Website, which points to http://www.gtk.org/
- UI Designer, which points to C:\Dev-C++\bin\fluid.exe, and use the icon
               file C:\Dev-C++\Icons\Fluid.ico
